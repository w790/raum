Instant Payments Notifications
IPN (Instant payment notifications, or callbacks) are used to notify you when transaction status is changed.
To use them, you should complete the following steps:
Generate and save the IPN Secret key in Payment Settings tab at the Dashboard;
Insert your URL address where you want to get callbacks in create_payment request. The parameter name is ipn_callback_url. You will receive payment updates (statuses) to this URL address.**
Please, take note that we cannot send callbacks to your localhost unless it has dedicated IP address.**
important Please make sure that firewall software on your server (i.e. Cloudflare) does allow our requests to come through. It may be required to whitelist our IP addresses on your side to get it. The list of these IP addresses can be requested at partners@nowpayments.io;
You will receive all the parameters at the URL address you specified in (2) by POST request;
The POST request will contain the x-nowpayments-sig parameter in the header.
The body of the request is similiar to a get payment status response body.
You can see examples in "Webhook examples" section.
Sort the POST request by keys and convert it to string using
JSON.stringify (params, Object.keys(params).sort()) or the same function;
Sign a string with an IPN-secret key with HMAC and sha-512 key;
Compare the signed string from the previous step with the x-nowpayments-sig , which is stored in the header of the callback request;
If these strings are similar, it is a success.
Otherwise, contact us on support@nowpayments.io to solve the problem.

        return
    else:
        print("HMAC signature does not match")
Usually you will get a notification per each step of processing payments, withdrawals, or transfers, related to custodial recurring payments.
The webhook is being sent automatically once the transaction status is changed.
You also can request an additional IPN notification using your NOWPayments dashboard.
Please note that you should set up an endpoint which can receive POST requests from our server.
Before going production we strongly recommend to make a test request to this endpoint to ensure it works properly.

In case you do not indicate the price in crypto, our system will automatically convert this fiat amount into its crypto equivalent. NOTE: Some of the assets (KISHU, NWC, FTT, CHR, XYM, SRK, KLV, SUPER, OM, XCUR, NOW, SHIB, SAND, MATIC, CTSI, MANA, FRONT, FTM, DAO, LGCY), have a maximum price limit of ~$2000;
price_currency (required) - the fiat currency in which the price_amount is specified (usd, eur, etc);
pay_currency (optional) - the specified crypto currency (btc, eth, etc), or one of available fiat currencies if it's enabled for your account (USD, EUR, ILS, GBP, AUD, RON);
If not specified, can be chosen on the invoice_url
ipn_callback_url (optional) - url to receive callbacks, should contain "http" or "https", eg. "https://nowpayments.io";
order_id (optional) - internal store order ID, e.g. "RGDBP-21314";

success_url(optional) - url where the customer will be redirected after successful payment;
cancel_url(optional) - url where the customer will be redirected after failed payment;
is_fixed_rate(optional) - boolean, can be true or false. Required for fixed-rate exchanges;
NOTE: the rate of exchange will be frozen for 20 minutes. If there are no incoming payments during this period, the payment status changes to "expired";
is_fee_paid_by_user(optional) - boolean, can be true or false. Required for fixed-rate exchanges with all fees paid by users;
NOTE: the rate of exchange will be frozen for 20 minutes. If there are no incoming payments during this period, the payment status changes to "expired";
